## Extraction process

nubbeDB provided the data as postgresql database.
We have transformed the data to json for better processing with our transformation tool.
A schema was then created, leaning heavily on the provided data and personal experience with biological data. The schema will be improved regulary in cooperation with domain experts.
For the transformation we use [eccenca corporate memory](https://eccenca.com/products/enterprise-knowledge-graph-platform-corporate-memory)

The schema aswell as the dataset can be found at [https://nubbekg.aksw.org/dataset/index.html](https://nubbekg.aksw.org/dataset/index.html)
