Schema-v0.0.1
- Initial ontology of nubbe[KG]

Schema-v0.0.2
- Completely reforged the bioactivity data
    - removed unneeded data properties(Code/ActivityID/ExtraInformation)
    - remodeled the properties IC50,EC50,LD50,MIC,ED50,IC12 and MFC from classes to data properties
- added NUBBE-ID as unique identifier
- split the taxonomy into biological and metabolic class
- rearranged some descriptors to be in the correct subClass(mol. Volume, Molar Mass)
- removed automatic code as Compounds data property

Schema-v1.0.0
- moved SMILES to be a general Compound data property instead a unique identifier, as smiles might not be unique
- remodelled the taxonomy area to only cover the biological taxonomy, prepare to get linked with Catalogue of Life
- added the classyfire-class with properties about stuctural information of the compound, still a WIP

Schema-v1.0.1 (in progress/coming soon)
- remodelled the taxonomy class to just have a species-class, as this will be used to link with KGofLife
- remodelled the Isolation-Class to have distinct classes for city/state insstead of just data properties, which will be subclasses to a new location-class to further link by location with other datasets
